To set your availability in the very short term, for up to 48 hours, you can use 'Quick Availability’ by simply toggling a switch on the Discover screen. If you are set as "Available" in the marketplace, Job Posters will be able to view your profile for a shift which matches your role. They can then wish to "Make an Offer" to you.

Avoiding no-shows and last-minute cancellations can earn you rewards. However, we understand that things do happen, but as soon as you know that you cannot work for the shift, please cancel in time so that the Job Poster has time to make arrangements. Please ensure your availability is updated at all times to avoid any inconvenience. If there is a pattern of cancellation of shifts, then your account might get blocked. Please refer to the Cancellation Policy in case a need to cancel the shift does arise.
