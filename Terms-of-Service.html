            <p>
                Welcome to Kolligate. Kolligate is an online temporary staffing solution and marketplace that allows individuals seeking temporary staffing in medical
                offices (the “Job Seeker”) to be connected with organizations that are looking to fill temporary positions or shifts (the “Job Poster”).
                Kolligate’s goal is to connect the Job Seeker with the Job Poster. This ToS and the Privacy Notice apply to all Users regardless of whether
                they are Job Seekers or Job Posters. This ToS governs a User’s access to and use of the Services. By accessing or using the Services, the
                User agrees to be bound by these Terms as if these Terms were signed by the User in ink on a hard-copy agreement.
                Kolligate makes every effort to protect and secure the Personal Information that a User shares and adds to the Platform.
                The collection and storage of any Personal Information is subject to the terms enumerated in Kolligate’s Privacy Notice [INSERT LINK],
                which is incorporated in this ToS as if set forth at length herein.

                <i>The Registration Process</i>
                <br>
                A Job Seeker is an individual looking for a shift or position with a Job Poster. A Job Seeker will create a profile and sign in through the Website or App.
                The profile will include certain information relevant to a potential employer such as name, address, professional license number, etc. ("Personal Information").
                The Job Seeker can post “Contact Cards” so that a Job Poster may reach out about a potential position or shift.
                <br>
                A Job Poster is a potential employer that is
                looking to fill a temporary position or a shift at a medical office. The Job Poster will create an account in order to post “Shift Cards” which are advertising for
                open positions or shifts.
                <br>
                Job Seekers are not charged for any of the Services. Any fees or refunds are set forth in Exhibit “A” to the User Agreement,
                which may be amended from time-to-time as necessary or in the sole discretion of Kolligate.
                <br>
                <i>Termination or Cancellation Process</i>
                <br>
                A User can deactivate their account by filling out a form and sending it to support@kolligate.com. The form can be found here at Kolligate.com/contactus.
                Once a completed form is received, Kolligate will begin the process of deactivating the account within thirty (30) days. The actual deactivation itself may take longer than thirty (30) days.

                Job Posters are solely responsible to compensate a Job Seeker for any and all work performed. Further, the Job Poster is responsible for paying any
                applicable taxes, State, Federal, and Local, for the Job Seeker. Kolligate is not responsible in any way to pay a Job Seeker for any work performed
                as a result of connecting with a Job Poster by using the Services. The sole and only responsibility of Kolligate is to make the connection between
                the Job Seeker and Job Poster.
                <br>
                Kolligate provides access to Hire Rite, where Job Seekers can have a background check performed. Kolligate is not responsible for the
                background check, and provides this as a convenience for Job Seekers. Certain Job Seekers may not have provided a background check for Job Posters to review.
                In addition, certain Job Posters may not require or request a background check from a Job Seeker.
                For Job Seekers without background check, it is the sole and exclusive responsibility of the Job Poster to validate their identity and confirm professional
                license as the Job Poster would for any type of employment. Kolligate is simply a marketplace to allow Job Posters to meet Job Seekers.
                Kolliage is not responsible in any way for the actions or inactions of a Job Poster or Job Seeker.
                Kolligate does not independently verify any information provided by a Job Poster or Job Seekers. Users engage on the Platform and use the Services at their own risk.

                <i>Shift Cards and Contact Cards</i> <br>
                Kolligate creates a community for Job Posters to post Shift Cards for Job Seekers. Job Seekers can post Contact Cards
                containing contact information for Job Posters. Shift Cards and Contract Cards are not reviewed by Kolligate. They are created and provided by third
                parties (i.e. the Job Seeker or Job Poster) over whom Kolligate exercises no control; you acknowledge and understand that Kolligate has no control
                over the content of Shift and Contact Card, or any conditions third parties might impose once a Job Seeker has submitted an application or left the Site.
                For example, some of these third parties may attempt to charge Job Seekers a fee to apply for a job even though Kollidate does not charge Job Seekers.
                If you leave the Kolligate’s Site and choose to enter a third-party website, you accept any terms and conditions imposed by that third-party.
                Shift and Contact Cards are not posted in any particular way or manner or in any particular order. Kolligate has no obligation to screen any Shift or Contact Cards.
                Kolligate does not confirm the accuracy or completeness of any Shift or Contact Card, or other information submitted by a Job Poster,or any other User,
                including the identity of such Job Poster or User.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kolligate assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness,
                legality, reliability, or availability of any Shift or Contact Cards or any information included by a Job Seeker.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Job Seeker Profile and Data</i> <br>
                    By creating an account and including your Personal Data on a Contact Card (i.e. your name, contact information, resume), you are requesting and authorizing
                Kolligate to make that information available to Job Posters and other Users.
                <br>
                Kolligate is not responsible for the availability of any position posted on a Shift Card.
                Kolligate cannot vouch for the validity of the contact information provided to us by a Job Poster. Kolligate is not responsible for a Job Poster’s Shift Card,
                the application or the application process, messages, screener questions, skills assessments or their format or method of delivery. We do not guarantee
                the validity of a job offer and cautions Job Seekers to verify the validity of a job offer before taking an adverse action regarding their current employment situations.
                Job Seekers are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of any Job Poster or job offer. If a Job Seeker requires alternative methods of screening or application
                it is the sole responsibility of the Job Seeker to request such accommodation. There is no guarantee or assurance that the Job Seeker will be hired by using Kolligate.
                <br>
                Kolligate is not responsible for any personal health, safety of the Job Seeker or Job Poster, or any safety best practices.

                Feedback
                <br>
                After a shift is completed,
                the Job Seeker is offered a screen to provide feedback on their experience by indicating a “Thumbs Up”. Only positive feedback is allowed, but is not required.
                Therefore, any feedback (i.e. a Thumbs Up) in no way reflects the positive or negative opinion of any third party nor does it reflect the opinion Kolligate.
                Kolligate is not responsible for any positive feedback or the absence of any feedback on its site. The User specifically waives any claims or liability of
                Kolligate associated with feedback or the lack thereof.
                The order in which a Shift Card or Contact Card appears is random and does not reflect the presence or absence of any feedback.

                Users are responsible for safeguarding the password that they use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under his/her username and password. Therefore, you must not share or disclose your password with anyone. Kolligate recommends that you should use a “strong” password for each account that is unique to You or to access any account and one that is not used on any other service or account, e.g., a password that is not a dictionary term or other word, and combines numbers, upper case letters, lower case letters, and non-alphanumeric characters. The User acknowledges that passwords may be compromised no matter how strong the password. Kolligate is not liable to you for any loss or damage arising from any third-party accessing or using your account without your permission, regardless of how the third-party accesses your account.

                We respect other people's rights and expect Users to do the same. You will not post content or take any action on the Platform that infringes or violates someone
                else's rights or otherwise violates the law. We can remove any content or information on the Platform if we believe, based solely on our judgment and within our

                If we remove your content for any reason, and you believe we removed it by mistake, you have the ability to appeal that decision by sending an email to support@kolligate.com which explains why you believe that Kolligate should permit the content.

                Our rights: We reserve the right at all times (but will not have an obligation) to remove or refuse to collect or distribute any Content on the Services,
                to suspend or terminate Users, and to reclaim usernames and change passwords without liability to the Users. We also reserve the right to access, read,
                preserve, and disclose any data, information or other Content as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal
                process or governmental request, (ii) enforce these Terms and the applicable user Agreement, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii)
                detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or

            </p>
            <p>
                Entire Agreement: These Terms, together with the Privacy Notice, and the User Agreement (if applicable)
                which is incorporated herein by this reference as if set forth herein in its entirety, constitute the entire, complete and exclusive agreement between User
                and us regarding the Services, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, or whether established by custom, practice,
                policy or precedent, with respect to the subject matter of these Terms the Privacy Notice, and the User Agreement.

                Amendments to these Terms: We reserve the
                right to modify, supplement, or replace these Terms, effective upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice. Upon opening the Services for the
                first time after any changes to these Terms are made, you will be prompted to review the Terms within the Services. Your continued use of the Services after
                any such update or modification shall confirm your agreement to the modified version of the Terms. If you do not want to agree to changes to the Terms, you
                may terminate your account with us, or otherwise terminate your use of the Services, prior to the modified Terms taking effect, in which case the prior set
                of Terms in effect as of the date of termination shall continue to control any disputes or other issues that may arise regarding your use of the Services.
                Only modifications, supplements or replacements of these Terms as stated in this provision shall be valid and effective to amend the Terms.
                Any other purported amendments shall be void and of no force or effect.

                No Informal Waivers, Agreements or Representations:

                breach or any subsequent breaches. Except as expressly and specifically contemplated by the Terms, no representations, statements, consents, waivers
                or other acts or omissions by any party, Kolligate or its Affiliates shall be deemed legally binding on the other party or its Affiliates, unless expressly
                and specifically documented in a writing that refers to the Terms and states expressly the intent to modify or supplement the Terms, and that an authorized
                officer of Kolligate has executed physically or electronically.

            </div>
            <p>
                These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the law of ___________, and the federal laws of the United States of America,
                without regard to or application of any conflict of laws provisions or principles. Any dispute between us or arising out of these Terms,
                their performance, or the Service shall be determined by one arbitrator in binding arbitration administered by the American
                Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The language of the arbitration shall be English.
            </p>
            <p>
                To accommodate parties and witnesses that may be distant from each other, each hearing shall be conducted and all testimony
                shall be entered by audio conference or video conference.
                The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties and may be entered and enforced in any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Proceedings will be conducted on an individual basis. Neither the User nor Kolligate may seek to have a dispute heard as a class action,
                private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity.
                No arbitration or proceeding can be combined with another proceeding without the prior written consent of all parties to the arbitration or proceeding.
                If this class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, those parts will be severed and will be
                administered by the AAA pursuant to its Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations, with the remaining parts proceeding in individual arbitration.

            <p>
                If any provision of these Terms is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void, or unenforceable, the provision will be modified so as to render it enforceable and effective to the maximum extent possible in order to effect the intention of the parties with respect to the provisions within the context of the overall Terms. If a court or arbitrator finds the modified provision invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected.
